# SVGOMG / Trusted Web Activity

This project uses the
[Trusted Web Activities](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/10/using-twa) technology
to wrap [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) in an Android Application.

## Running the Demo

1. Clone the project
``
git clone https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/svgomg-twa.git
``

2. Import the Project into Android Studio, using File > New > Import Project, and select the folder
to which the project was cloned.

3. Run the Project (Ctrl+R)

### Enabling Debug

TWAs require [Digital AssetLinks](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/) to be setup
on both the application and on the website, in order to enable the validation that allows Chrome to
open the page in full-screen.

For security reasons, the signing key compatible with the setup on
https://svgomg.firebaseapp.com/ is not committed with the sample code.

It is possible to setup Chrome to skip validation on device to enable testing.

Here are the 2 steps required to achieve this:

1. Enable Chrome to accept command-line parameters:

On the Android Device, go to the Chrome version being used to test the TWA and navigate to
`chrome://flags`. Search for a setting called `Enable commmand line on non-rooted devices` and
change it to `Enabled`. Restarting the browser *multiple* times may be required.

2. Create an Android file with the command-line parameters that allow skipping the TWA validation.

Add a file at `/data/local/tmp/chrome-command-line`, with the content
`_ --disable-digital-asset-link-verification-for-url="https://svgomg.firebaseapp.com"`. Make sure
there's not newline at the end of the line, or it may break the launcher.

For convenience, a shell script that creates this file is available in this repository. Run it
by executing `./enable-debug.sh https://svgomg.firebaseapp.com`.

To debug a different PWA, execute the script with a different host:
`./enable-debug.sh https://example.com`

### Wrapping Up

Assuming the  `assetlinks`  file in place in your domain and the  `asset_statements`  tag configured in the Android application, the next step is generating a signed app. Again, the steps for this are widely  [documented](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign-apk).

The output APK can be installed into a test device, using adb:

``
adb install app-release.apk
``

If the verification step fails it is possible to check for error messages using the Android Debug Bridge, from your OSâ€™s terminal and with the test device connected.

``
adb logcat | grep -e OriginVerifier -e digital_asset_links
``

As the debug certificate is different from the release one, and the fingerprint for debug should not be listed on the assetlinks.json file, you could test release's version in your device with APK generated, before to [upload your app to the Play Store](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/upload-bundle).
